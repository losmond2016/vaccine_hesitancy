The data used in this study was obtained from the London School of Hygeine and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). The surveys were conducted online with UK adults. 
The wave 1 survey was conducted from 29/09/2020 to 14/10/2020. The wave 2 survey was conducted from 09/04/2021 to 27/04/2021.
This folder contains:
-	The full survey question text for each question used in the analysis.
-	A data dictionary outlining the variable names and values for each of the cleaned datasets used for modelling.

Full survey scripts and raw data are available upon request.

Please note:
-	While the COV_INFO question texts vary slightly between waves (from asking about ‘Trust’ in media sources in wave 1, to ‘Use’ of media sources in wave 2), Exploratory data analysis suggests data patterns at these questions are consistent. As such, they have been treated as equivalent for modeling purposes.
